      <h2 id="research-problem">Research Problem</h2>

<p>A public vulnerability report usually contains vulnerable software versions, the severity of the vulnerability, and even the Proof-of-Concept (PoC) input to  reproduce  the  failure  pertaining  to  the  vulnerability. However, recent research<sup><a href="#reference">[1,2,3]</a></sup> shows that incomplete and incorrect vulnerable software versions are prevalent in vulnerability reports, making users of under-reported vulnerable versions at risk.</p>

<p>Existing techniques such as code clone detection and patch presence testing could potentially be applied to verifying a vulnerability on different software versions. However, these static analysis techniques might generate high false positives because they cannot confirm the existence of the vulnerability through a PoC that triggers the target vulnerability.</p>

<p>In this work, we introduce a systematic, automated approach to assessing the under-reported vulnerable versions for a reported vulnerability. Technically, taking a PoC for the reference vulnerable version as input, we utilize a fuzzing-based method to generate a new PoC for the target version to trigger the same vulnerability. We implement this idea as an automated tool, named SCTrans. On 30 real-world CVEs, SCTrans successfully identify <strong>330</strong>
versions of software that MITRE/NIST fails to report as vulnerable.</p>

<p>We plan to release the <a href="#open-source-protocol">source code</a> and <a href="#open-source-protocol">datasets</a> of SCTrans, see <a href="#open-source-protocol">our sharing policy</a> for more details.</p>

<h2 id="approach-overview">Approach Overview</h2>

<p>To solve the problem mentioned above, we introduce an automated tool, SCTrans, implemented a trace-aware fuzzing method that continuously adjust the reference PoC  to maximize the similarity between the execution trace generated by the reference PoC and the one generated by the adjusted PoC on the target version. Following this way,  we have a higher chance to generate a new PoC that triggers the same vulnerability on the target version.</p>

<p>In particular, SCTrans runs in the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>SCTrans collects <em>T<sub>ref</sub></em> (Reference Trace) and <em>T<sub>target</sub></em> (Target Trace) with the given PoC on the reference version and the target version, respectively.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>SCTrans performs cross-version trace alignmenton <em>T<sub>ref</sub></em> and <em>T<sub>target</sub></em> to get the aligned functions between the two traces.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a crash is observed on the target version, SCTrans uses crash triage to verify whether this crash is triggered by the target vulnerability.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Based on the aligned cross-version execution traces, SCTrans performs execution detours reasoning to locate the critical variables that cause these execution detours.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>SCTrans uses fuzzing-based detours correction to mutate the input bytes that are related to the critical variables.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All the mutated inputs are evaluated with the crash triage and given scores based on the similarity between their traces and <em>Tref</em>. If none of the seeds triggers the target vulnerability, they are inserted into a prioritization queue according to their scores. The seed with the highest score will be selected for next round of mutation (goto Step-4).</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="open-source-protocol">Open Source Protocol</h2>

<p>Recent research shows that, public vulnerability reports (e.g., those achieved by MITRE/NIST) usually contain incomplete information about the software’s vulnerable versions, making users of under-reported vulnerable versions at risk. In light of this, we are glad to release our tool SCTrans and dataset for vulnerability assessment to the community, to better understand or mitigate this problem. However, to avoid misuse of our tool and dataset, we apply simple authentication to verify the identity of the user who wants to request access to our source code and dataset. So, if you are interested in SCTrans and want to obtain access to our source code and dataset, please read the following instructions and send your request email to Yuan Zhang (yuanxzhang@fudan.edu.cn) and Jiarun Dai (jrdai14@fudan.edu.cn).</p>

<p><strong>=======  Instructions about Request Email =======</strong></p>

<p><strong>For Academic Researchers:</strong></p>

<p>If you are a student(or postdoc), please have your advisor (or host) send us an access email. If you are a faculty member, please send us an email from your university email account.</p>

<p>In your email, please include your name, affiliation, and home page (if we do not recognize each other). This information is required only for verification purposes. Please note that if we are unable to determine your identity or affiliation, your request may be ignored.</p>

<p>If your papers or articles use our dataset or our tool, please cite our CCS 2021 paper.</p>

<p><strong>For Industry Researchers:</strong></p>

<p>If you are currently in industry (including research labs), please send us an email from your company’s email account.</p>

<p>In the email, please briefly introduce yourself (e.g., name and title - in case we don’t know each other) and your company.</p>

<p><strong>Mail Content:</strong></p>

<p>In the email, please include a justification letter (PDF format) on official letterhead. The justification letter needs to acknowledge the “SCTrans” project from Fudan University and clearly state the reason for requesting the dataset or source code. Also, confirm that the dataset or source code will not be shared with others without our permission.</p>

<p>We emphasize that we will ignore emails that do not follow the above instructions. Please note that we may disclose on the <a href="https://jouisseuse.github.io/SCTrans">homepage</a> of SCTrans the list of universities, research labs, and companies that have requested our datasets. Again, you are not allowed to share any samples from our source code/dataset with others without our permission. Sending us an email requesting access to our source code/dataset implies that you are aware of and agree to the above policy.</p>

<h2 id="dataset">Dataset</h2>

<p>When evaluating the performance of SCTrans, we randomly selected 30 real-world CVE reports from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). These 30 CVEs influence 6 broadly adopted software  in  the  user space,  covering  6  types  of  vulnerabilities: heap OOB, stack OOB, divide-by-zero, segmentation fault, integer overflow, and null pointer dereference. As shown in the following table, the dataset consists of 30 reference CVE-version pairs and 470 target CVE-version pairs.</p>

<p>We plan to open source this dataset, containing the inputs needed by SCTrans to run tests on these CVE-version pairs. Please follow our sharing protocol to get the dataset.</p>
